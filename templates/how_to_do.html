							<p>Ancient times have proved that education plays a crucial role in a child’s skill development. Assigning homework is one of the major elements that spark the adeptness staying inside them. It was believed that homework would help students understand their sessions better yet the results of this invention oppose the statement at present. While homework helps in achieving good results, it also causes some students to stress and anxiety. At times when they have a lot of errands to do, they find it tough to manage it all in a day. Students are left with little zeal to do their homework and that lack of enthusiasm is seen in their assignments and homework.</p>
							
							<h2>Tips To Do Your Homework In An Easy And Fast Way!</h2>
							<p>Homework has made students less productive as it takes their long hours to complete homework rather than using it for other chores. Looking upon the benefits it has for student life, we can’t blame homework alone for everything. You just need the hints on how to do your homework faster.  We have a solution to this problem written below. Let’s get started :</p>
							<h4>MANAGE YOUR TIME :</h4>
							<p>Everyone suggests managing your time, handling your time effectively, etc. but no one guides you on how to do that exactly. Well, don’t panic! You just need to make a schedule for the whole day. The schedule should include the right time to do your homework and other errands.</p>
							
							<h4>FIND A WELL-LIT ENVIRONMENT :</h4>
							<p>Find a comfortable and well-lighted environment to study. Bed and floor can be an uneasy place to study as it will either make you sleep or feel exhausted soon. The well-lit place will not put a strain on your eyes. Furthermore, it will increase your speed of doing homework without any obstacles. So try to sit on a chair and table which would help you keep your back straight.</p>
							<h4>FRAME A TO-DO- LIST :</h4>
							<p>When you are set up with a timetable, mark the list of work to be done and evaluate the time required for each activity. Consider that completion of each task would require some extra 5-10 minutes than estimated. After all, you are not a speedometer. Once you complete one task, you can satisfyingly cross it off the list.</p>
							<h4>SET YOUR PRIORITIES :</h4>
							<p>You need to realize what is more important than others. Assign priorities of homework according to the due dates. Label each type of priority work and manage accordingly. The highest priority work should be completed first and then turn to next. This would avoid the last moment panic of completing the assignment due the very next day.</p>
							<h4>GATHER UP ALL YOUR ESSENTIALS :</h4>
							<p>Effective time management would be ensured if you geared up all the essential resources in advance. It would help you concentrate better on your studies.</p>
							<h4>STUDY AT A QUIET AND ALONE PLACE :</h4>
							<p>Sit down for studies at a very quiet place where no family member can disrupt you. Apart from family, stay away from any kind of distractions that might affect your studies. Zero disturbances will fasten up the pace of your homework.</p>

							<h4>CUT YOURSELF OFF FROM SOCIAL MEDIA :</h4>
							<p>Detach yourself from all social networking apps when you sit down for studies. It is the toughest job for you, especially at present when your happiness starts and ends with your mobile phone. Once you exercise this control, it will help you focus better on your homework. Use your mobile or laptop for research work or when really necessary.</p>
							<h4>TRY LIGHT CLASSICAL MUSIC :</h4>
							<p>Studies proved that students who listen to light, mellow classical music tend to study better than others. Music with no lyrics, beats, or pop will not serve as a distraction. Try and suggest others too.</p>

							<h4>PROVIDE YOURSELF SHORT BREAKS IN BETWEEN STUDIES :</h4>
							<p>Continuous work can make you feel restless. Go for short breaks when you feel necessary. Breaks should not mean staying on social media and forgetting about pending work. Short breaks can actually serve as a motivation to do homework. It will bring back your enthusiasm to work again. If you feel stressed, go talk to any family member who can motivate you to do your homework.</p>

							<h4>DRINK PLENTY OF WATER WHILE DOING HOMEWORK :</h4>
							<p>Good health can boost your thinking ability. Drinking water while doing homework will help you finish homework faster by staying fresh and active.<br>
							Some healthy snacks like jaggery, chickpeas, roasted snacks, etc. can also boost your speed while taking care of your health. Avoid having sugary drinks and eatables</p>
							<h4>TAKE HELP WHEN NEEDED :</h4>
							<p>Try taking help from family, friends when you feel stuck on a problem. Elder family members are considered more educated than you. Consider the friends that are involved in healthy group discussions. Make groups with tutors and classmates to have a healthy debate on various topics. It will boost your learning. It is the best motivation to do your homework. When asking for help from family members, avoid unnecessary long talks.</p>
							<h4>STICK TO THE TIMER :</h4>
							<p>Set up a timer for each activity and stick to it. It would act as a motivation to do your homework. Don’t worry if you can’t reach the goal. Believe it and you will achieve it. This way you would avoid all distractions just to reach the goal.</p>

							<h4> APPRECIATE YOUR WORK :</h4>
							<p>Once you are finished, reward yourself with something you like. This way you will stay fresh for the next task. If you finished a task earlier than the set time, use that task to roam out in fresh air or for a short break. The reward will help you keep on going with the flow. Stay focused and you will get better with time.</p>

							<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
							<p>As it is rightly said, “Excess of everything is bad”. Homework is necessary but excess of it can also prove to be harmful to students. No doubt learning can be made fun of via homework but too much of it can put a lot of pressure on students. Stress would not bring the best out of them, giving rise to depression, anxiety, and many other health problems. Whereas, students should also realize that there are other important things than the use of technology. They must learn to manage their time and utilize it for more necessary work. Once they learn how to manage their time and work, classes will also be a fun activity for students. The right amount of homework would decrease a student's repulsion from studies. The responsibility lies on both sides: teachers as well as students. Both need to cooperate with each other and make education more than just getting homework done.</p>
